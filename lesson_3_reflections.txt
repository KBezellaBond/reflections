When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository is useful when you work on several different computers. A remote 
repository also makes collaboration easier.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having GIT
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Your remote repository may represent a collaboration between you and a team of
programmers. You may not want to pull all of their changes into your local
repository immediately.
