What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize a depository, using "git init", creates a git file and 
attaches it to the repository. Without a git file, you would not be 
able to track the history of the repository's files or make use of Git's
functionality.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as an intermediate stage between the working
directory and the repository. It offers space and time to reconsider the
structure of your commit.
