What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initialize a depository, using "git init", creates a git file and 
attaches it to the repository. Without a git file, you would not be 
able to track the history of the repository's files or make use of Git's
functionality.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area serves as an intermediate stage between the working
directory and the repository. It offers space and time to reconsider the
structure of your commit.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

You can use git diff --staged to view the differences between your 
staged files and the most recent commit. From this list, you can 
determine whether you have one logical change (or more than one)
logical change.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your
history organized? How would branches help?

Branches would be helpful when you want to experiment with one aspect 
of the game, or when two developers are working on different aspects. 
Branches help by allowing for various experiments or threads to evolve
simultaneously, while keeping the master branch intact.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams look like a tree, showing how the other branches relate to
the master branch (or trunk).

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we
represent it in the diagram the way we do?

When you merge two branches together, you also merge their histories 
(by commit date). The representation in the diagram shows two branches
reconnecting and proceeding as one.
